# web-based_box-and-block-test
This is an web-based approach to the Box and Block test that is used in hand rehabilitation to assess gross manual dexterity.

The application needs to be uploaded on a web hosting server under a specific domain name.
The domain name must be added in the PHP files wherever needed.
Also there is the need of a relational database called bbt, with a user called bbt. The password of the database must be added in the files wherever needed.

Using the admin folder, allows users to see statistics and results saved in the database from all the users of the application.

The application can also run without the use of a hosting server, lacking the capability of saving scores. To do that all php code must be removed, and all php files should be renamed.
